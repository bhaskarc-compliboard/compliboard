// Refuses a test run that has quietly narrowed itself.
//
// `HOW-WE-BUILD.md` §3: a validator that has only ever said PASS is untested — and a suite
// that has stopped running half its cases still says PASS. A stray `.only` narrows a run to
// one test and reports green; a `.skip` removes a case and reports green with a count nobody
// reads. Neither is a failure anywhere, which is what makes it the harness's own version of
// check 14's weaker-than-its-assertion problem.
//
// Three guards, all cheap:
//   1. no `.only` anywhere in the suite
//   2. zero skipped, zero todo in the run
//   3. the total is not BELOW the recorded floor — a suite may grow, never silently shrink
//
// The floor is committed. Raising it is a deliberate edit; failing to raise it after adding
// tests costs nothing, so the guard cannot become an obstacle.

// 493 -> 504 on 25 Sep: two for the AI_SCAN_STRUCTURED switch (a near miss like "flase" must
// leave the schema ON, never quietly drop it) and nine for chooseSignificantDate, which took the
// one field the page hangs off away from the model after it dated a 2021 plan "Renewal 1 January
// 2026" — a date that appears nowhere in the document.
//
// 489 -> 493 on 25 Sep: four more in extractJsonText.test.ts for the one failure no extractor
// can fix — an unescaped quote inside a string value — and for the JSON schema that replaced
// the extractor as the mechanism on the scan path.
//
// 473 -> 489 on 25 Sep: tests/unit/extractJsonText.test.ts, 16 tests covering the balanced-brace
// scan. Ten of them are real model responses copied verbatim into tests/fixtures/json-extraction/
// — the five answers Documents Run 2 discarded, the two Run 1 discarded, and three that always
// parsed and must keep coming out byte-identical.
//
// 444 -> 426 on 23 Sep: `lib/answerDisplay.ts` and its 18 tests were DELETED on the owner's
// decision. Run 3's `AnswerBody` replaced it and `grep -rn answerDisplay app lib components`
// returned only the file itself — the suite was exercising code nothing shipped. Lowering the
// floor is exactly the deliberate act this guard exists to force somebody to make in writing.
